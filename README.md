# Tenzies

This project is a digital version of a dice game involving ten dice. The objective is to keep rolling the dice until all of them display the same number. I developed it as part of a series of challenges during the Learn React course on the Scrimba platform. After completing the project on the platform, I added three additional features to the game. First, I replaced the numbers on the dice with dots. Second, I introduced the ability to track the number of rolls. Finally, I implemented a feature that saves the lowest roll count to storage.

## Features

1. Hold Die: Users can click on individual dice to hold them, preventing them from rolling during the next click of the roll button.
2. Dots instead of numbers: Dice faces display dots instead of numbers, using a grid layout for accurate and visually appealing dot positioning.
3. Roll Counter: Tracks and displays the current number of rolls during the game.
4. Lowest Roll Count: Stores and displays the lowest roll count achieved, saved in local storage to persist across multiple sessions.

## Possible Improvements
1. Time Challenge: A time-based challenge mode, in which players must achieve tenzies within a specific time.
2. Leaderboard: List with names and top scores of players.
